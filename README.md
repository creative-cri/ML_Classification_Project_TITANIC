                                 Project: Predict Titanic Survival

Goal of this project.

The goal of this project is to predict either person survived or not. We would use such charachetristics to analyze: gender, age, ticket class etc.

In the train doc we have full information and in the test we are missing survive or not, as this would be our task to predict it.

part: analyse + compare data
part: Supervised ML Logistic Regression & Decision Trees & Random Forest & Support Vector Machine.
The RMS Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage in 1912, crossing the Atlantic from Southampton, England to New York City. The ship never completed the voyage, sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg, bringing down 1,502 of 2,224 passengers onboard. In this project you will create a Logistic Regression model that predicts which passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on features like age and class.
